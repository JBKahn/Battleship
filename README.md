Battleship
==========

A simple python implimentation of the battleship game.

The game prompts the user for the number of human players, the size of the board and the number of each type of ship.

The user may place theri own ships or have them placed randomly on the board.

Each turn the user is shown his board and his view of the opponents board after clearing the previous view by printing newline characters.

The CPU players are 'dumb' and they fire randomly without any kind of intelligence or strategy.
